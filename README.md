## Baba Ghanouj

Created Tuesday 09 April 2019

Source: [NYT](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014030-baba-ghanouj)

### Description

    YIELD: About 2 cups
    TIME: 1 hour 15 minutes

As sesame tahini sits, the oil separates, so the mixture should be stirred before it’s used. Sesame tahini should be slightly runny — virtually all of the imported brands that I use have this consistency, but domestic versions can be thick and pasty, and a bit flavorless. You can find imported tahini in Mediterranean markets and in many grocery stores. It must be stored in the refrigerator once opened. Baba ghanouj is a signature Middle Eastern grilled eggplant puree enriched with tahini and seasoned with lemon juice and lots of garlic. The dish has a smoky, pungent flavor. Don’t forget to pierce the eggplant before you put it on the grill. You can also grill it inside over a gas flame.

### Ingredients

**FOR THE BABA GANOUSH**

-   ☐ 2 pounds eggplant, preferably small eggplants

-   ☐ ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (more to taste)

-   ☐ ¼ cup sesame tahini, stirred if oil has separated out

-   ☐ 1 to 2 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt, as needed

-   ☐ 2 garlic cloves, cut in half, green shoots removed

-   ☐ Salt to taste

**FOR THE GARNISH**

-   ☐ Extra-virgin olive oil

-   ☐ Chopped flat-leaf parsley

### Preparation

#### Step 1

Prepare a hot gas or charcoal grill. Pierce the eggplants in several places with a fork or the tip of a knife, and place over the hot coals. Grill, turning regularly, until soft and blackened all over. If you don’t have a grill but do have a gas stove, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover the top of your stove under the burner grates with foil to facilitate cleaning. Turn on your oven fan (so the smoke alarm won’t go off), and roast the eggplants directly over the flame, turning often until charred and softened. Small, thin eggplants will cook through this way, but larger eggplants must be finished in the oven. Wrap in foil, and place in the hot oven for 20 minutes until thoroughly softened. You can also roast the eggplant under a broiler until charred and softened. The flavor of the baba ganoush will not be as smoky.

#### Step 2

Place the grilled eggplant in a colander in the sink, and allow to cool and drain. Peel and discard the black skins, cut off the stems, and let the eggplants sit in the colander to drain for another 15 to 30 minutes.

#### Step 3

Puree the eggplant in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the lemon juice, yogurt and tahini. In a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic to a paste with a generous pinch of salt. Add to the food processor, and blend with the eggplant. Add salt to taste.

#### Step 4

Mound the puree in a bowl or on a platter, and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with pita bread.

Misir Wot, Ethiopian spicy lentil stew, is a healthy, protein packed dish made with few basic ingredients and a flavorful berbere spice mix!

I enjoy Ethiopian cuisine and couldn’t wait to try my hand on some of the recipes. So I decided to make the Ethiopian Berbere Spice blend that I can use to season lentils, chicken and fish. I used Cayenne pepper, paprika, fenugreek seeds, dried ginger, coriander, cloves and few other spices that I had in my pantry. Here is a more detailed recipe for homemade Berbere Spice Blend.

### Description

    PREP TIME: 5 minutes
    COOK TIME: 2 minutes

Berbere Spice Blend is used as a seasoning in Ethiopian cuisine. It adds warmth and depth to fish, chicken and stews. I also love adding berbere spice to burgers, soups, tacos or in dips with olive oil and lemon juice.

Berbere represents a blend of cultural and geographic influences from the spices of India to the chile peppers of the New World. My version of this spice mix has hot peppers, black pepper, coriander, fenugreek, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice and cloves.

### Ingredients

-   ☐ 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper

-   ☐ 5 teaspoons paprika

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon whole coriander

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon whole fenugreek seeds

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon ground ginger

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon ground cardamom

-   ☐ 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

-   ☐ 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

-   ☐ 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

### Preparation

#### Step 1

Lightly roast coriander seeds and fenugreek seeds. Allow to cool and then grind.

#### Step 2

Mix with rest of the spices and keep in an airtight container. Makes about 4 tablespoon of spice mix.

### Description

Here’s a lean, green chili that still packs some spicy heat! If you like yours mild, substitute a couple of seeded and chopped green bell peppers for the jalapeño and serrano chiles and omit the cayenne pepper. Serve this hearty stew with grated cheese on top and cornbread, rice, or tortilla chips on the side.

![450](/doc/chili_verde.png)

### Ingredients

-   ☐ 2 tablespoons olive oil

-   ☐ 1 pound ground turkey (93 percent lean)

-   ☐ 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

-   ☐ Grated Monterey Jack cheese, for serving

### Preparation

#### Step 1

Select the Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and heat the oil. Add the turkey and sauté, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula as it cooks, for about 5 minutes, until cooked through and no traces of pink remain.

#### Step 2

Add the onion, chiles, garlic, salt, oregano, cumin, and cayenne and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes, until the onion has softened and is translucent. Stir in the pinto beans, salsa verde, and broth.

#### Step 3

Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Press the Cancel button to reset the cooking program, then select the Bean/Chili setting and set the cooking time for 20 minutes at high pressure.

#### Step 4

Let the pressure release naturally for at least 10 minutes, then move the Pressure Release to Venting to release any remaining steam. Open the pot and stir in the chopped cilantro.
Ladle into bowls and serve hot, topped with the cheese.

## Pressure Cooker Coconut Curry Chicken

Created Tuesday 09 April 2019

Source: [NYT](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018857-pressure-cooker-coconut-curry-chicken)

### Description

    YIELD: 4 servings
    TIME: 1 hour

The highly spiced coconut sauce here is so good, you’ll want to slather it on anything! And it’s a great and adaptable medium for cooking other proteins — not just chicken. Try cubes of lamb, fish fillets, or chunks of pork. Or, if you prefer boneless chicken breasts to thighs, use them here, pressure-cooking them for 2 minutes instead of 4.

When serving, tell your guests to be aware of the cardamom pods so they don’t accidentally bite into one—or use the ground cardamom instead. And note that brands of garam masala vary in terms of their chile content, so some are hotter than others. If you’re unsure how hot your mix is, add it gradually to the pot, tasting as you go.

![450](/doc/coconut_curry_chicken.png)

### Ingredients

-   ☐ 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, crushed by hand

-   ☐ 3 tablespoons ghee, unsalted butter or safflower oil

-   ☐ 3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil

-   ☐ 2 cups finely chopped onions

-   ☐ 6 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced

-   ☐ 2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon cumin seeds

-   ☐ 1 3-inch cinnamon stick or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

-   ☐ 8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat side of a knife, or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom

-   ☐ 2 teaspoons ground coriander

-   ☐ 1 tablespoon kosher salt

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon ground turmeric

-   ☐ ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

-   ☐ ¼ teaspoon black pepper

-   ☐ 2 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

-   ☐ 2 teaspoons garam masala

-   ☐ ½ cup canned unsweetened coconut milk

-   ☐ Cooked basmati rice, for serving (optional)

-   ☐ Plain yogurt, for serving (optional)

-   ☐ 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

### Preparation

#### Step 1

Transfer diced tomatoes to a bowl and crush by hand until no large chunks remain.

#### Step 2

Using the sauté function, heat the ghee and the coconut oil in the pressure cooker. Stir in the onions and cook, stirring often to encourage even browning, until they are caramelized, 12 to 18 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger and cumin seeds; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon and cardamom and cook for another minute. Then stir in the coriander, salt, turmeric, red pepper flakes, black pepper and finally the tomato purée.

#### Step 3

Add the chicken to the sauce, cover and cook on high pressure for 15 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a plate. Using two forks shred the chicken into thin strings. If the sauce seems too thin, simmer the sauce on the sauté setting until it has thickened to taste. (Note that the coconut milk will thin the sauce down further.) Stir in the  shredded chicken, garam masala and the coconut milk, and let the curry sit for 20 minutes for the flavors to meld. Serve with the rice and yogurt, if desired. Garnish with cilantro.

## Punjabi Channa

### Description

    YIELD 4 servings
    TIME 1 1/2 hours

An Indian chickpea stew, Punjabi chana is a plain-Jane of a dish: beige beans in a tomato-based spiced sauce, flecked with minced cilantro. Mixed with rice, though, it becomes a soulful meal whose charms are hard to resist.

This version of the dish came to The Times from Heather Carlucci-Rodriguez, then the chef and owner of Lassi, a tiny sliver of an Indian cafe in Greenwich Village, since closed.

![450](/doc/punjabi_channa.png)

### Ingredients

-   ☐ 1 tablespoon canola oil or other vegetable oil

-   ☐ 1 medium onion, chopped

-   ☐ 2 teaspoons minced garlic

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon minced ginger

-   ☐ 1 small Thai bird chili, chopped

-   ☐ 2 large tomatoes, chopped

-   ☐ 1 ½ teaspoons paprika

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon salt, or as needed

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon ground coriander

-   ☐ ½ teaspoon garam masala

-   ☐ ¼ teaspoon turmeric

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

-   ☐ 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained

-   ☐ 2 tablespoons minced cilantro

-   ☐ Cooked rice for serving (optional)

### Preparation

#### Step 1

In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat oil and add onion. Sauté until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger and chili, and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/4 cup water. Cover and cook until tomatoes are very soft, about 5 minutes, then remove from heat.

#### Step 2

Purée mixture in blender or food processor until smooth. Return to pan and place over medium heat. Add paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, coriander, the garam masala, turmeric and lemon juice. Add chickpeas and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.

#### Step 3

Cover and simmer until sauce is thick and chickpeas are soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir pan about every 10 minutes, adding water as needed (up to 1 1/2 cups) to prevent burning. When ready to serve, sauce should be thick. If necessary, uncover pan and allow sauce to reduce for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until desired consistency. Stir in cilantro, adjust salt as needed and serve with cooked rice, if desired.

## Rice Cooker Chicken Biriyani with Saffron Cream

YIELD 4 to 6 servings
TIME 1 hour
```

Fairuza Akhtar, a restaurant owner in Jackson Heights, Queens, who was born in Pakistan, has developed a quick method for making fragrant, creamy biriyani with whole spices and bites of chicken, at home in her rice cooker. "My mother would fall down in a faint," she said, referring to the traditionally reverent attitude toward biriyanis in Northern India and Pakistan. "But rice cookers are the way of the modern world."

![450](/doc/biriyani-articleLarge.jpg)

### Ingredients

#### FOR BIRIYANI:
- [ ] 1  pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- [ ] 1  cup plain yogurt, preferably whole milk
- [ ] 1 ½  teaspoons coriander powder
- [ ] 1  teaspoon turmeric powder
- [ ] 1  teaspoon mild chile powder
- [ ] ½  teaspoon cumin powder
- [ ] 1  onion cut into chunks
- [ ] 1  2-inch chunk fresh ginger, peeled
- [ ] 3  garlic cloves, peeled
- [ ] 1  fresh green chile pepper such as jalapeño or Serrano, stemmed
- [ ] 3  tablespoons canola oil or ghee (clarified butter)
- [ ] 1 ½  cups basmati rice, rinsed
- [ ] 6  cloves
- [ ] 6  cardamom pods
- [ ] 1  cinnamon stick
- [ ] 3  cups chicken broth (use low-sodium if canned) mixed with 1/4 teaspoon garam masala
- [ ] 1  teaspoon salt
- [ ] Pinch saffron threads mixed with 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- [ ] 3  tablespoons chopped cilantro, more for garnish
- [ ] 3  tablespoons chopped mint
- [ ] 1  lime
#### FOR OPTIONAL GARNISHES:
- [ ] Oil for frying
- [ ] 1  onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] Big handful cashews
- [ ] Big handful raisins

### Preparation

#### Step 1
Cut chicken into bite-size chunks: 6 to 8 pieces from each thigh. In a bowl, mix yogurt and powdered spices. Add chicken, mix well to coat, and set aside.

#### Step 2
In a food processor, purée onion, ginger, garlic and chili pepper together. Set aside.

#### Step 3
In a rice cooker, heat oil in cooking bowl on ''cook.'' When hot, add onion paste and cook, uncovered, until some liquid has evaporated and paste begins to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally.

#### Step 4
Add rice and whole spices and stir well. Smooth top and arrange marinated chicken pieces over surface.

#### Step 5
Gently pour in broth and salt. Cover and let cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes depending on cooker.

#### Step 6
When done (or when cooker switches to "warm" function), add saffron cream and mix, making sure to scrape and scoop up bottom layer of rice. Sprinkle chopped cilantro and mint on top and re-cover. Let steam 5 minutes more.

#### Step 7
If making garnishes, heat 1 inch oil in a pot until rippling. Add onion and cook, separating rings, until golden brown. Lift out and drain. Add cashews and raisins to same oil and cook until cashews are golden brown. Lift out and drain.

#### Step 8
Just before serving, squeeze lime over biriyani and mix very well, fluffing lightly. Scoop onto serving platter and garnish with chopped cilantro and fried onions, cashews and raisins.

#### Tip
> Lacking a rice cooker, biriyani can also be made in a heavy round pot with at least a 3-quart capacity. After adding broth in Step 5, raise heat to bring mixture to a simmer, then immediately reduce heat to very low. For Step 6, turn heat off.

## Sheet-Pan Tostadas With Black Beans and Peppers

Created Tuesday 09 April 2019

Source: [NYT](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019573-sheet-pan-tostadas-with-black-beans-and-peppers?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

### DESCRIPTION

    YIELD 4 to 6 servings
    TIME 1 hour

In this vegetarian sheet-pan meal, crisp tortillas are topped with chile-laced black beans, sweet roasted peppers, avocado and plenty of crumbled queso fresco or grated Cheddar. A cumin salt, flecked with lime zest and sprinkled on right at the end, adds both brightness and a musky spice flavor. You will need 3 sheet pans for this. If you have only 2, crisp the tortillas in a skillet on the stovetop instead of in the oven.

![450](/doc/sheet_pan_tostadas.png)

### Ingredients

-   ☐ 3 medium bell peppers, thinly sliced (preferably at least one red and one yellow)

-   ☐ 1 medium yellow onion, sliced

-   ☐ ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed

-   ☐ 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed

-   ☐ 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage

-   ☐ 4 thyme sprigs

-   ☐ 2 (14- to 16-ounce) cans black beans, drained

-   ☐ 1 cup canned diced tomatoes with their liquid

-   ☐ 1 chipotle chile in adobo, chopped, plus 1 teaspoon adobo sauce

-   ☐ 2 large garlic cloves, finely grated or minced

-   ☐ 1 teaspoon dried oregano

-   ☐ ¾ teaspoon ground cumin

-   ☐ 8 (6-inch) corn tortillas

-   ☐ 1 lime

-   ☐ Sliced avocado, for serving

-   ☐ Crumbled queso fresco or grated white Cheddar, for serving (optional)

-   ☐ Chopped cilantro leaves, for serving

### Preparation

#### Step 1

Heat oven to 400 degrees and arrange racks in the top and bottom thirds of oven. On a rimmed sheet pan, toss together peppers, onion, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and sage, then spread vegetables out in an even layer. Top with thyme sprigs, and roast on the top rack until tender and lightly browned, 35 to 45 minutes, tossing every 15 minutes or so.

#### Step 2

On a separate rimmed sheet pan, toss together beans, tomatoes, 1/4 cup oil, chipotle chile and sauce, garlic, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and salt to taste. Roast on the bottom rack, stirring every 10 minutes, until juices have thickened, 25 to 35 minutes.

#### Step 3

Brush tortillas on both sides with oil, then arrange in an even layer on a third rimmed baking sheet (it’s O.K. if the tortillas overlap slightly). Bake until crisp, about 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately sprinkle with salt while they are still hot.

#### Step 4

To make the cumin salt, grate the zest from the lime. In a small bowl, stir together lime zest, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Cut naked lime into wedges.

#### Step 5

To serve, top tortillas with beans, peppers, avocado, queso fresco (if desired), cilantro and a squeeze of lime from the wedges. Let people sprinkle on lime-cumin salt to taste.
